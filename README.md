### About me

Hi there! My name is AndrÃ©.

I'm a data professional based in Rio de Janeiro with 4+ years of experience spotting and exploring business opportunities from a consumer-centric perspective. I stand out for my multidisciplinary curiosity and the ability to translate business and client needs into well-structured analytical projects.

My main expertise and interests lie on topics such as segmentation studies, resource allocation, market research and the development of predictive models to support decision-making in the domain of marketing.
